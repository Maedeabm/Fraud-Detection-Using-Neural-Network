        "\n",
        "  Model Complexity: Add more layers or nodes to the LSTM network to increase its capacity to learn more intricate patterns. However, be careful with overfitting. Always monitor the validation set performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regularization: If overfitting becomes an issue after making the model more complex, consider introducing L1 or L2 regularization in the model layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematically tune hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, dropout rates, batch sizes, etc. You can use tools like Keras Tuner or Scikit-learn's GridSearchCV.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Feature Engineering: It's a more time-consuming approach, but can you derive any other features from the existing ones? Maybe ratios between balances, or aggregations, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ensemble Techniques: Combine the LSTM model with other models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, or even simpler linear models. An ensemble method like stacking or blending could provide improved performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Advanced Resampling Techniques: Besides SMOTE, there are other resampling techniques, such as ADASYN or Borderline-SMOTE, that could potentially give better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Learning Rate Annealing: Decrease the learning rate over epochs. Keras provides learning rate schedules or callbacks for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use Bi-directional LSTMs: Bi-directional LSTMs consider information from both past (backwards) and the future (forward) states simultaneously."
