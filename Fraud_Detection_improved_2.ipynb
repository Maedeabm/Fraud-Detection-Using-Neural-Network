        "To improve the detection of those sneaky unicorns (fraudulent transactions), let's deploy a series of enhanced techniques and strategies. Here's a plan of action:\n",
        "1. Class Imbalance Solutions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your dataset, being heavily imbalanced, is a classic issue in fraud detection. We've used SMOTE before, but there are other techniques too:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Under-sampling: Reduce the number of regular transactions (horses) to match the number of frauds. However, be cautious: you might lose vital information this way.\n",
        "    Combined SMOTE and Under-sampling: First, increase the frauds using SMOTE and then reduce the genuine transactions to balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Feature Engineering:\n",
        "\n",
        "Expanding our clues to hunt those unicorns. Maybe there are other parameters or combinations of parameters that give clearer signals of a fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Transaction aggregations: For example, calculating the average transaction amount for a user over a day and comparing it with the current transaction.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  Time-based features: Like, is there a specific time when frauds are more likely?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. More Advanced Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTM is powerful, but there are other architectures and algorithms worth trying:\n",
        "\n",
        "  GRU (Gated Recurrent Units): Similar to LSTM but can be faster and just as effective in some cases.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  1D Convolutional Neural Networks: Great for sequence data, and sometimes combined with LSTM/GRU layers.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ensemble methods: Like combining predictions from Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to get a more robust result.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use tools like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for your model. Think of it as adjusting the focus on a telescope to get the clearest view of stars (or in our case, unicorns).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Evaluation Metric:\n",
        "\n",
        "Given our problem, accuracy isn't the best metric. We should prioritize Recall (to catch as many frauds as possible) but also keep an eye on Precision (to avoid too many false alarms).\n",
        "6. Threshold Tuning:\n",
        "\n",
        "After training, instead of using the default 0.5 threshold for classification, adjust it to find the sweet spot where Recall and Precision are balanced. Imagine this as adjusting the sensitivity of our unicorn detector.\n",
        "7. Regularization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding L1 or L2 regularization can prevent overfitting and make the model generalize better on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, in the wild world of machine learning, especially with fraud detection, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's a cycle of trying, learning, and refining. Let's give these steps a shot and see how close we get to becoming the ultimate unicorn hunter! 🦄🔍"
